## **eMonitor+**
eMonitor+ is designed to monitor digital media platforms using AI and carry out big data analysis to identify misinformation, hate speech, violence against women, electoral campaign violations, political pluralism and polarization, spending on electoral campaign ads, perception and sentiment towards elections, among others. The platform works in four languages, Arabic, English and French, and Spanish and relies on machine learning to track and analyze the content on digital media during elections to generate graphical representations for data visualization and reports.

## **Our five phases approach**
<G>Phase I:</G> The methodology of eMonitor+ is driven based on a bottom-up approach that includes forming the core team at the local level and working together to define the scope of the project and the areas of support and topics to be tracked.
 

<G>Phase II:</G> eMonitor+ methodology will be adapted and customized to the local context based on the country's legal framework, including laws related to elections, defining the main political actors, media outlets, influencers, and accounts to follow. In addition, developing the M&E framework and the risk and mitigation analysis.
 

<G>Phase III:</G> Increasing knowledge and skills and building capacity of the core team on the theoretical and practical approaches to digital media monitoring, combating mis/disinformation and hate speech, and prevention of violence against women online.
 

<G>Phase IV:</G> Tracking, collecting and analyzing data to be analyzed by the monitors manually and the platform's algorithms automatically. The data analysis is then visualized on a customized dashboard.
 

<G>Phase V:</G> Developing policies and recommendations driven by data and analytics, including developing a sustainability strategy at the national level and creating an environment where information is always collected and exchanged to inform policymaking.
